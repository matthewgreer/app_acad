# Recursion

## Agenda: 
1. Review yesterdays projects - conceptual questions? or hw?
2. What is recursion? - Cofee demo 
3. Recursion examples 
4. Iteration v. recursion


## What is recursion? 
- Method that calls itself


## What do we need to write a useful recursion method? 
1. base case - simplest version of the problem
2. inductive step / recursive step - calls the method again and change one of the parameters that gets to base case
