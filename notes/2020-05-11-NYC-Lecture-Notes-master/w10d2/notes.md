## What is React
JavaScript library we use to build user interfaces for web applications.

## A Brief History
Created by Facebook developer in 2011, make open source in 2013

## Motivations - Why do we use it?
React builds a virtual DOM which speeds up DOM manipulation (editing a blueprint is faster than editing the building)
React components can be reused
Provides reactive interface when data is changed

## React vs. jQuery:
jQuery can get messy - lots of updating, many listeners on the same elements
React will auto update any component listening to specific data when that data is changed
