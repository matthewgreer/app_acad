      The Box Model
    </h1>

    <div>
      Just a small town girl
      Livin' in a lonely world
      She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
      Just a city boy
      Born and raised in South Detroit
      He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

    <div>
      Strangers waiting
      Up and down the boulevard
      Their shadows searching in the night
      Streetlights people
      Livin' just to find emotion
      Hidin' somewhere in the night
      Don't stop believin'
      Hold on to that feelin'
      Streetlight people
    </div>

    <div></div>
    <span>Whoa-oh ooooohhhhhhhh!!!!</span>
